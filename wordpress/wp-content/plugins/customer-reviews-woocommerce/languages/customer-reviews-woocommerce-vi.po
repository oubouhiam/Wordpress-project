msgid "Configure Customer Reviews for WooCommerce to send automatic follow-up emails (reminders) that gather shop and product reviews. Review reminders are sent via an independent service CR (Customer Reviews) integrated with the plugin because people commonly consider reviews managed by shops themselves to be biased or fake. Independent collection of customer feedback also enables other optional features of the plugin such as trust badges or verification of reviews.<br><br>Before enabling this feature you MUST update your terms and conditions and make sure that your customers consent to receive an invitation to review their order. By enabling and using this plugin, you agree to the <a href=\"https://www.cusrev.com/terms.html\" target=\"_blank\">terms and conditions</a>."
